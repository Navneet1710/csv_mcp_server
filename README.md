# ðŸš€ CSV MCP Server â€” Bring Your Data to Life in Claude

## Why This Matters

If you've ever tried to analyze CSV data in Claude.ai, you've probably hit a wall.
You couldn't just hand it a file â€” instead, you had to:

- Copy and paste CSV snippets (often hitting text limits)
- Upload files elsewhere to summarize or filter
- Explain what's inside the file manually

That's inefficient, error-prone, and breaks your workflow.

## Enter the CSV MCP Server

This tool connects Claude directly to your local CSV files, so it can explore, query, and summarize your data â€” all from within the chat.

With it, you can say things like:

**"Claude, show me all customers from New York with purchases over $1000,"**

and it just works.

## What This Server Does

Once connected, Claude can:

âœ… See and list the CSV files in your local directory

âœ… Understand their structure (columns, datatypes, preview rows)

âœ… Run queries using natural language or Pandas syntax

âœ… Generate summaries (mean, median, counts, etc.) for any column

âœ… Handle large files efficiently â€” all without sending your data online

Your data stays on your machine. Claude just talks to this local server through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Why It's Different

Unlike cloud-based CSV tools, this one is:

- **Local-first & private** â€” nothing leaves your system
- **Fast** â€” built with FastMCP
- **Flexible** â€” you can extend it to support Excel, TSV, or other formats
- **Seamlessly integrated** â€” Claude becomes your data analyst

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Claude Desktop app
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

### 1. Install

Clone and enter the repo:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd csv_mcp_server
```

Install dependencies:

Using uv (recommended):
```bash
uv sync
```

Or using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Your CSV Directory

In `main.py`, edit line 14:
```python
CSV_DIRECTORY = Path.home() / "Documents" / "csv_files"
```

You can point this to any folder where you keep your CSV files.

### 3. Run the Server
```bash
python main.py
```

## Connecting to Claude

Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

Add the MCP server entry:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "csv-analyzer": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\csv_mcp_server\\main.py"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Save and restart Claude Desktop.

## How to Use It

Once running, try these prompts inside Claude:

### List available files
*"What CSV files can you see?"*

### Preview data structure
*"Show me the structure of sales_data.csv."*

### Run filters
*"From customer_data.csv, list all customers in California with orders above $500."*

### Get stats
*"Summarize the 'revenue' column in quarterly_report.csv."*

### Do analysis
*"Find the correlation between age and satisfaction in survey_results.csv."*

## Tools and Resources

| Type | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Resource | `csv://list` | Lists all available CSV files |
| Resource | `csv://{filename}` | Preview a CSV (first 10 rows) |
| Tool | `read_csv(filename, rows)` | Read full or partial CSV data |
| Tool | `get_csv_info(filename)` | Get metadata and structure |
| Tool | `query_csv(filename, query)` | Filter data using Pandas query syntax |
| Tool | `get_csv_statistics(filename, column)` | Compute descriptive statistics |

## Directory Layout

By default, your files go in:

```
Documents/
â””â”€â”€ csv_files/
    â”œâ”€â”€ sales_data.csv
    â”œâ”€â”€ customer_info.csv
    â”œâ”€â”€ inventory.csv
    â””â”€â”€ financial_report.csv
```

## Customization

### Change folder:
Edit `CSV_DIRECTORY` in `main.py`.

### Add formats:
Extend file-reading functions to handle Excel, TSV, etc.

### Create new tools:
Add more `@mcp.tool()` functions for custom queries or analysis.

## Troubleshooting

### "Directory does not exist"
â†’ Make sure the path exists or create it:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/csv_files
```

### "File not found"
â†’ Check filename and ensure it's in the correct directory.

### Claude doesn't detect the server
â†’ Restart Claude Desktop, confirm config path and Python installation.

### Permission issues
â†’ Verify Claude can access your folder (or run as admin on Windows).

### Debugging
Run directly:
```bash
python main.py
```
